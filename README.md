formula
=======

A Python form rendering and validation library.

## Version 2.0

At some point in the future, when I get some spare time, I'd like to create a version 2.0.  This version of Formula was hacked together at a moment's notice to be used for a project.  Version 2.0 will be planned much more carefully, focusing on these three goals:

* Ease of use
* Extensibility
* Clear and thorough documentation
