formula
=======

A Python form rendering and validation library.

## Version 2.0

At some point in the future, when I get some spare time, I'd like to create a version 2.0.  This version of Formula was hacked together at a moment's notice to be used for a project.  Version 2.0 will be planned much more carefully, focusing on these four goals:

* **Ease of use.**  Easy for a developers to use in their projects; developers should be able to understand the basics with only a few minutes of reading the documentation.  Clear and concise syntax, and friendly error messages if developers do anything stupid.
* **Extensibility.**  Plenty of options for developers that need to do a bit more than the most basic form, and plenty of hooks for developers that need to bend the library to their will.  Some plugins should come in the package, such as a plugin for Twitter Bootstrap.
* **Clear and thorough documentation.**  For every capability of Formula, there should be documentation for a developer to discover that ability.  Getting started should be a breeze with a tutorial covering the basics, with concise text and plenty of code samples.
* **100% tested.**  Nuff said.
